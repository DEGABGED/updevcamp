bio: "Likes to keep things simple. Theory is important. You might one day find yourself trying to solve something not knowing that it cannot be solved (undecidable) or that there is  no fast solution (intractable) or simply there is already a solution to it and at that point, you're just trying to reinvent the wheel."
